## Menu ##

1. SQL Squelch level
    * 0-9
    * The squelch mutes the speaker of the transceiver in the absence of reception. With the squelch level correctly set, you will hear sound only while actually receiving signals and it significantly reduces battery current consumption. It is recommended that you set to Level 5.
    * I have my squelch sensitivity set to 3. The higher it is the more sensitive it is. 
2. STEP Frequency Step 
    * 2.5 / 5 / 6.25 / 10 / 12.5 / 25 kHz

5. VOX Voice Operated Transmission
    * OFF / 0-10
    * This function makes it not necessary to push the [PTT] on the transceiver for a transmission. Transmission is activated automatically by detecting your voice. When you have finished speaking, the transmission is automatically terminated and the transceiver will automatically receive incoming signals. 
    * Be sure to adjust the VOX Gain level to an appropriate sensitivity to allow smooth transmission.
6. W/N Wideband / Narrowband
    * WIDE / NARR
    * In areas where the RF signals are saturated, you must use the narrow band of transmission to avoid interference in adjacent channels.
7. ABR Display Ilumination
    * OFF / 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 s
8. TDR Dual Watch / Dual Reception
    * OFF / ON

9. BEEP Keypad beep
    * OFF / ON
10. TOT Transmission timer
    * 15 / 30 / 45 / 60 ... 585 / 600 seconds
    * This function can automatically controls the time to transmit each time you press [PTT] on the transceiver. This feature is useful to avoid over heating of the transistors. The transceiver will turn off transmission after the set amount of seconds. 
11. R-DCS Reception digital coded squelch

23. MDF-B under channel mode, B channel displays.  (name display can only be set by PC software.)
    * FREQ / CH / NAME
24. BCL busy channel lockout
    * OFF / ON
    * The BCLO feature prevents the radio's transmitter from being activated if a signal strong enough to break through the "noise" squelch is present. 
    * On a frequency where stations using different CTCSS or DCS codes may be active, BCLO prevents you from disrupting their communications accidentally (because your radio may be muted by its own tone decoder).
25. AUTOLK keypad locked automatically
    * OFF / ON
26. SFT-D direction of frequency shift
    * OFF / + / -
    * The "OFFSET" is the difference or offset between the reception frequency and the frequency of transmission for access to amateur radio repeaters. Set the "OFFSET" according to the OFFSET amateur radio repeater through which want to communicate.
27. OFFSET frequency shift
    * 000.000 ... 69.990
    * When communicating via a repeater, the repeater listens on one frequency and transmits on another, the difference between these frequencies is the offset. 
    * For example If we want to make a communication through amateur radio repeater whose frequency input is 145,000 MHz and output is 145,600 MHz the "OFFSET" is 000.600 MHz and the direction of SHIFT to '-' so the transceiver will always be 145,600 MHz in frequency when you receive and when you press [PTT] to transmit, the frequency will automatically move to 145,000 MHz

**NOTE:** Keep in mind that you can program frequencies that are illegal to use with your amateur radio privileges. This radio does not inhibit transmitting on these frequencies so if you accidently transmit you will be heard on that frequency (police, weather, taxi, fire, etc.) The way to avoid this is to use the programing software and enter a transmit frequency of 000.000 MHz). We have not found a way of entering 000.000 in the manual programing mode.

## Accessing repeaters ##

Tune your radio to the output frequency of the repeater (the frequency the repeater transmits on.) (Enter frequency mode and use the keypad to enter this frequency)

The repeater takes transmissions on one frequency (its input frequency) and repeats it to a slightly offset frequency which is what your radio is tuned to listen on. The difference between these two frequencies is known as the offset (menu 26) - certain bands have standard offsets (see below) but the repeater may be an exception so it's worth checking. 

If the output frequency of the repeater is higher than the input frequency, then the repeater has a negative directional shift,  (menu 25) and visa versa.

The only other thing you need to connect to a repeater is the Tone (menus 10-13). In order to trigger the repeater to accept your transmission you need to know the tone or code of the repeater. This will likely be one of two types of tone DCS or CTCSS. It's a non-audible tone that the repeater hears to know that you want it to repeat what you are transmitting. Most repeaters have the same receive tone as they do transmit tone. 

On your radio, the Transmit tone is what is transmitting to the receiver, and the receive tone is what you get back. I have found that some repeaters don't work for me if I have the recieve tone set. So keep an eye out that if you can transmit to the receiver but can't hear anything, try turning off the recieve tone.

### Standard Repeater Input/Output Offsets ###

Band             Offset  
6 meters         1 MHz  
2 meters          600 kHz  
1.25 meters    1.6 MHz  
70 cm              5 MHz  
33 cm             12 MHz  
23 cm              20 MHz

* Press MENU again to lock in your selection If you have voice turned on (Menu # 14) the radio will announce  confirmed . 
* Press the EXIT key to leave the menu system. 

### Long distance communication through a repeater ###

To establish long distance communications through an amateur radio repeater, which needs to receive a 1750 Hz tone. Press and hold the [PTT] button then press the [BAND] button to transmit a 1750Hz tone.

## Squelch codes ##

 In some cases you may want to establish communications in a closed group at a particular frequency or channel. For that you can use "CTCSS" or "DCS" for reception. 

The "squelch" opens only when receiving a frequency with "CTCSS" or "DCS" code that is same as programmed in your transceiver. If codes of the received signal differs from those programmed in your transceiver, the "squelch" will not open and the received signal can't be heard.

**NOTE:** The use of "CTCSS" or "DCS" in a communication, does not guarantee complete confidentiality in your communication.

## Troubleshooting ##

### The radio does not start. ###

* The battery could be low, try replacing the battery
* The battery may not be installed correctly, take out and put the battery back in

### The battery runs down quickly. ###

* The battery life could have come to an end and you need a new battery
* The battery may not be fully charged 

### The receiving indicator LED lights but do not hear the speaker ###

* Make sure the volume is not set too low
* Make sure the squelch undertones (CTCSS or DCS) are the same in your transceiver as they are for everyone else
* Try turning off the receive DCS/CTCSS
* Try turning down the squelch sensitivity 

### When transmitting, the other members of the group do not receive communication ###

* Make sure the squelch undertones (CTCSS or DCS) are the same in your transceiver as they are for everyone else
* You may be too far away from the other party
* You or the other party may be in an area with bad Radio signal propagation. 

### In "standby" mode the transceiver transmits without pressing [PTT] ###

* Check the level of adjustment VOX is not too sensitive

### Receiving communications from other groups whilst you are communicating with your group ###

* Change frequency or channel
* Change the squelch undertones (CTCSS or DCS) for you and your group

### Communications with other members of the group is poor or low quality ###

* You or the other party may be in an area with bad Radio signal propagation. For example a tunnel, underground, in a mountainous area or built up urban structure.
